Chapter 12 [Advanced Features]
- This introduces us to a new feature in MongoDB called aggregation
- This are built in functions that help us find distinct, like values between collections.
- To manage and display large amount of data in a single page we can use pagination and reduce browser rendering
- page rendering is also a great way to improve page performance and display large amount of data.
- Authentication via Google api is also touched in this module, this include adding the google api library into application.
- We need our project registered with google and client id to sign in and sign out.
- Getting the app ready to deploy include parametrize all external resource variables like database url, ssl encryption, and build a release version of the product
- Flux pattern is also a react pattern to handle deeply nester ui hierarchy. not much is said about this topic

[My Reflection]
- Over all i learnt a lot of new thing, especially got a complete picture how a full stack applications are developed, how different frameworks integrate in running the application
- I wanted to learn Flux patterns but the module didnt had much to saw.
- Didnt get a chance to work with Google authentication api
- React was hard to start off when you come from basic html,cc learning but its get very familiars with time and patterns
